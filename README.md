# Javascript-Countdown-Timer

This is a Javascript countdown timer that plays a sound when it is started and again when it gets below 10 seconds remaining.

It generates the sounds using the browser audio context, no .wav or .mp3 files are needed!

See [this repo](https://github.com/mlflanagan/Workout-Timer) for an example of how to use it.
