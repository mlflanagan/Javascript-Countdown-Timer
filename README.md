# Javascript-Countdown-Timer

This is a Javascript countdown timer that plays a sound when it is started and again when it gets below 10 seconds remaining.

It generates the sounds using the browser audio context, no .wav or .mp3 files are needed!

You must pass it a callback function for the display, and optionally another callback for when the timer expires to, for example, reset buttons or display a message on your web page.

See [this repo](https://github.com/mlflanagan/Workout-Timer) for an example of how to use it.
